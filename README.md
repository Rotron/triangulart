# Triangulart

Dummy graphic editor to make isometric illustrations. It's like pixel art, but for triangles.

Try it on (maxwellito.github.io/triangulart)

The editor is really basic but does the job pretty well. Unfortunately, many features are missing: touch screen support, undo, fill, move a group, zoom...
